# basketball_points_counter_app

## Getting Started

This project used to count the basketball score for two teams.

This project uses different important widgets as:
- StatefulWidget.
- ElevatedButton.
- SizedBox.
- VerticalDivider.
- It also handles the size of the text that shows the score as if it increases its digits increase so it handles that using FittedBox.
